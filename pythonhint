Assuming you have defined functions for each of your "things to do",
which I will refer to as A(), B(), ...

todo_list = (A, B, C, .... Z)
for i in range(3, len(todo_list) + 1):
    for j in range(x):
        for k in range(i):
            todo_list[k]()

does x reps of A,B,C
then x reps of A, B, C, D
then ...

I think that's right.  It's a weird sort of a loop to be doing...

The change to make it do, eg., x reps of A, x reps of B, x reps of C, ...
is left as an exercise.  :-)
